# iOS Native Directory

This directory contains the native iOS code for the React Native app.

## Structure

This directory is typically auto-generated by Expo using:
```bash
expo prebuild
```

## Manual Creation

If you need to manually set up this directory, you would need to:
1. Create Xcode project structure
2. Configure Podfile
3. Set up native dependencies
4. Configure app permissions

## Note

This directory is usually excluded from git (.gitignore) as it's auto-generated.
